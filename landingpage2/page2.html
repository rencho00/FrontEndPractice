                                Web developers design and create websites. They are responsible for the look of the site. They are also responsible for the site's technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the
                                site can handle.

                                A marketing technology stack is a grouping of technologies that marketers leverage to conduct and improve their marketing activities. Often, the focus of marketing technologies (aka "martech") is to make difficult processes easier, and to measure the
                                impact of marketing activities and drive more efficient spending.
